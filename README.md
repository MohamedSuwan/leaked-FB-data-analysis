# leaked-FB-data-analysis
on April 2021 more than half a billion Facebook user's data have been leaked.
around three million belong to Jordanians.

this repo was made to analyze the data, the data was in a good clean shape, just required some touches and modification.

the analysis will not show sensitive data like the emails or phone numbers, just a simple analysis like phone carrier,email domain,religion and gender.
